# Nodevisor

Simple server management and application deployment, fully in your control.
Nodevisor **unifies** shell scripts across platforms, eliminating complexity and helping you avoid the common pitfalls of server management.

With **Nodevisor** you can:

- Control everything directly from your code, yaml, or web (coming soon)

## Challenges without Nodevisor

Without **Nodevisor**, managing servers and deploying applications can be difficult and time-consuming:

- **Complicated Deployments:** Deploying and scaling applications involves juggling scripts, dependencies, and configurations.
- **Security Risks:** Sensitive data can be exposed in shell history or logs.
- **Scaling Issues:** Scaling infrastructure manually becomes increasingly complex.
- **Fragmented Tools:** Multiple tools lead to disorganized workflows and inefficiency.

## Features

- **Universal Deployment:** Easily scale from one server to thousands.
- **Secure by Design:** Protects sensitive data like passwords from exposure.
