# Nodevisor License

Depending on the type of your legal entity, you are granted permission to use Nodevisor for your project. Individuals and small companies are allowed to use Nodevisor to automate server configurations for free (including commercial use), while a Company License is necessary for for-profit organizations and teams of a certain size. This two-tiered approach is designed to support the ongoing development of Nodevisor while keeping the source code accessible and free for most users.

## Free License

### Eligibility

You can use Nodevisor for free if you are:

- An individual using Nodevisor for personal use.
- An organization or team managing up to 2 servers
- A non-profit or not-for-profit organization.
- Evaluating Nodevisor to see if it’s a good fit, without using it commercially.

### Allowed use cases

Under the “Free License,” eligible users are granted permission, free of charge, to use Nodevisor for both non-commercial and commercial purposes in managing server configurations. You may also modify Nodevisor to fit your needs or contribute improvements or bug fixes to the Nodevisor community.

**_Note:_** Commercial use is allowed under the Free License for managing up to 2 servers. If you are managing more than 2 servers, you will need a Company License.

### Who needs a Company License?

A Company License is required if you:

- Are managing more than 2 servers.
