# Nodevisor

Simple server management and application deployment, fully in your control.
Nodevisor **unifies** shell scripts across platforms, eliminating complexity and helping you avoid the common pitfalls of server management.

With **Nodevisor** you can:

- Control everything directly from your code, yaml, or web (coming soon)
- Set up and manage all your servers.
- Deploy and scale your applications effortlessly.
- Do anything you can with the shell—only in a simpler, more efficient way.

## Challenges without Nodevisor

Without **Nodevisor**, managing servers and deploying applications can be difficult and time-consuming:

- **Platform-Specific Scripts:** Different OS commands make shell scripts inconsistent.
- **Manual Server Management:** Setting up and managing servers manually leads to errors and inefficiencies.
- **Complicated Deployments:** Deploying and scaling applications involves juggling scripts, dependencies, and configurations.
- **Security Risks:** Sensitive data can be exposed in shell history or logs.
- **Scaling Issues:** Scaling infrastructure manually becomes increasingly complex.
- **Fragmented Tools:** Multiple tools lead to disorganized workflows and inefficiency.

## Features

- **Universal Deployment:** Easily scale from one server to thousands.
- **Secure by Design:** Protects sensitive data like passwords from exposure.
- **Automated Dependency Management:** Automatically handle package installations.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript Scripting:** Write scripts in your preferred language.
- **SSH Support:** Execute commands both locally and remotely via SSH.

## Coming soon

- **Cross-Platform:** Full support for Linux, Unix, and Windows (versions >= LTS).
- **YAML Configuration:** Configure servers easily using YAML files.
- **GitHub Actions Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with CI/CD pipelines.
- **Web Interface:** Manage and control your servers through an intuitive, user-friendly web interface.
